# Mercurio
Mercurio is an AI-powered pipeline that takes a product URL (currently from Amazon), scrapes key product information and media assets, generates a custom promotional script using OpenAI, and turns it into a short (15â€“30 sec) video.

Mercurio utilizes Pywright library to fetch product data from amazon site. 

The homepage consists of a single input box for entering the amazon link:

After entering the image, a workflow with unique uuid will be created and the data 
- Product Name
- Product Description 
- Product Images, main and alt 
will be auto-filled.

With just one press of a button, you can generate four different advertisement prompts using OpenAI's API.

And finally after selecting the prompt you preper, using Remotion, two videos will be generated with the text overlay.
